## Key skills for Data Science roles

::: nonincremental
-   Techniques - Do you have broad technical knowledge? Can you learn a new method, understand its value, and implement it?

-   Translation - Do you know enough about a research problem and data to propose an appropriate solution?

-   Communication - Can you provide a simple explanation for a complex technique? Can you explain the value add, limitations, and impacts of your analyses to a non-technical audience?

-   Programming - Are you an expert in at least one or more programming language? Are you continuously developing this skill?

-   Time and Project Management - Can you work on several projects at once and meet your deadlines?

## Transitioning to Leadership

Some changes I've experienced going from an independent contributor to a leader/manager:

-   You are directly dependent on others to meet your goals
-   You are responsible for the work of others
-   Buy-in of colleagues and staff is essential
-   Prioritization is important to gaining buy-in
-   Decisions have to be made without full information
-   You need to use your "political capital" wisely
